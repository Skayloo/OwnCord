# Session — 2026-03-30

## Goal

Remediate 10 test quality bugs identified during code review,
covering type-checking, native E2E resilience, Rust unit tests,
assertion quality, integration coverage, and test hygiene.

## What Was Done

- **BUG-058:** Created `tsconfig.build.json` to unblock prod E2E; added `typecheck` and `typecheck:build` npm scripts
- **BUG-059:** Hardened native E2E (CDP timeout 30->60s, exponential backoff, config timeouts doubled)
- **BUG-060:** Added 25 Rust unit tests across 4 modules (`commands.rs`, `ws_proxy.rs`, `livekit_proxy.rs`, `credentials.rs`)
- **BUG-061/067:** Added behavioral assertions to server coverage tests (replaced empty/trivial checks)
- **BUG-062:** Upgraded low-signal test assertions in livekit-session, device-manager, channel-controller tests
- **BUG-063:** Consolidated native E2E skip gates into `beforeEach` blocks
- **BUG-064:** Added 9 new integration tests (channel CRUD, member lifecycle, DM, presence)
- **BUG-065:** Replaced 3 fixed sleeps with condition-based waits in E2E specs
- **BUG-066:** Verified toast/audio tests already cleaned (no action needed)
- **TS type errors:** Fixed 115 TypeScript errors across 21 test files — non-null assertions for strict indexing, mock typing (`vi.fn<any>()`), missing fields in test fixtures (`color`, `version`, `deleted`, `permissions`)
- Updated docs: CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, TESTING-STRATEGY.md to reflect new `typecheck` scripts and expanded Rust test coverage

## Decisions Made

- *No architectural decisions this session*

## Blockers / Issues

- None

## Next Steps

- Verify all tests pass in CI after these changes
- Continue toward 80%+ coverage targets across all layers
